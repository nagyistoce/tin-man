#summary Information about the Nao agent

= Introduction =

The Nao robot is the current model for agents in the competitive !RoboCup 3D Simulated Soccer league.

= Code =

In !TinMan, the class [http://code.google.com/p/tin-man/source/browse/trunk/TinMan/NaoBody.cs NaoBody] represents this agent model and provides named properties for accessing the hinges.  This class also models restrictions upon each hinge's angular range.

= Anatomy = 

The Nao agent has 22 degrees of freedom (DOF) via its 22 hinges.  Each hinge is referred to by its name in code.

==Hinges==

This diagram shows the assignment of hinge names across the agent's body.  In the posture shown, all joints are at zero degrees.
