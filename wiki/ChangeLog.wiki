= 0.5.0 =

_Released 2011-02-12_

  * Added support for drawing various shapes in the [https://sites.google.com/site/umroboviz RoboViz] monitor while the agent is running, allowing visual insight into your agent's calculations and intent.
 * Some very minor API changes that may cause compilation errors:
   * The simulation context is now a property rather than an argument to {{{Think}}}.  
   * {{{UniformNumber}}} has been moved from {{{PerceptorState}}} to {{{ISimulationContext}}} in the same way that {{{TeamSide}}} moved a few releases ago.
 * Created additional {{{Initialise}}} and {{{Shutdown}}} methods that agents may optionally override to perform tasks at startup and exit.
 * Added additional constants to {{{FieldGeometry}}}.

= 0.4.3 =

_Released 2011-02-12_

  * Fixed a bug in the parser that surfaced in cultures where periods are used as thousand separators, not decimal separators.  This is an important fix for teams intending to run their agents in competitions hosted in foreign countries!

= 0.4.2 =

_Released 2011-02-10_

  * Moved {{{TeamSide}}} property from {{{PerceptorState}}} to {{{ISimulationContext}}}, fixing a bug where the property's value wasn't being set.  The server only sends this value at startup.
  * Fixed bug whereby all observed players were reported as being opponents, even if they were actually team mates.

Thanks to Saleha Raza for reporting these issues.

= 0.4.1 =

_Released 2011-02-07_

  * Fixed a bug whereby setting {{{IAgent.IsAlive}}} to false wouldn't tear down the {{{AgentHost}}}.
  * Fixed a potential runtime exception in {{{PerceptorState.ToString}}}.
  * Added generic type parameter constraint that {{{TBody}}} in {{{Agent<TBody>}}} must be a class.
  * Comparisons between floating point number now use comparison with epsilon.
  * Standardising code formatting, and replacing leading tabs with whitespace.
  * Completed API XML documentation.
  * Small improvements to {{{AgentHost}}} for both performance and readability.
  * Created {{{AgentHost.DefaultHostName}}} property.
  * Removed unnecessary method from {{{Wizard}}}.
  * Some documentation corrections for {{{Wizard}}}.
  * Added comments to disable certain !ReSharper inspections.
  * Fixed a presentation bug in {{{PlayerPosition.ToString()}}}.
  * First release to include both Release and Debug builds.

= 0.4 =

_Released 2010-10-26_

  * Added parser support for {{{(setSenseMyPos true)}}} option in {{{naoneckhead.rsg}}}.  Value appears in {{{PerceptorState.AgentPosition}}}.
  * API documentation improvements.
  * New {{{FieldGeometry}}} consts {{{BallRadiusMetres}}}, {{{BallMassKilograms}}}.
  * Removed references to host {{{"yoda"}}} from sample code.
