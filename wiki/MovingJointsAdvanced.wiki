#summary A discussion of the finer points of agent joint movement

If you are unfamiliar with agent joints, read [MovingJointsBasic] first.

= Introduction =

RoboCup3D attempts to provide a realistic simulation of how a real robot would perform in the real world.

 * Physics is simulated, including gravity, inertia and friction
 * [Perceptors] have calibration error and random noise
 * Joint [effectors] are modelled as electric motors

It's important to note that your agent's joints do not, by default, have any feedback loop built in.  Any control circuitry must be built explicitly into your agent.  This gives quite a bit of flexibility but can be complex.  This page aims to break down the complexity.

=Characterising a Hinge Joint=

In order to understand how joints are modelled, let's run through some experiments.

Let's apply a very short burst of 'force' to a shoulder hinge joint and see how far the arm moves before coming to rest.

Here's an implementation of `IAgent.Step` that does this:

A servo drive is a special electronic amplifier used to power electric servo motors. It monitors feedback signals from the motor and continually adjusts for deviation from expected behavior.
