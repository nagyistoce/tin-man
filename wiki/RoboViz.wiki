= !RoboViz =

!RoboViz is a project by Justin Stoecker in collaboration with the !RoboCup group at the University of Miami's Department of Computer Science.  It offers several features, as shown in this video:

The remainder of this article deals with !TinMan's support for the programmable drawing feature (seen from around 1:20 in the video.)

= Programmable Drawing =

In order to draw on the visualisation, your agent must connect directly to the monitor and transmit commands.  In !TinMan, this is done via an object-oriented API.

== A Simple Example - Displaying Localisation Calculation ==

Let's implement an agent that draws a dot on the screen to show where it thinks it is.  !TinMan does not currently include a localiser implementation, so let's assume we have a simple localisation service available with the following interface:

{{{
public interface ILocaliser
{
    bool Update(PerceptorState state);
    Vector3 GetPosition();
}
}}}

And here is the code for our complete agent:

{{{
public sealed class LocalisationSimpleVisualisationAgent : AgentBase<NaoBody>
{
    private readonly ILocaliser _localiser;
    private Dot _locationDot;

    public LocalisationSimpleVisualisationAgent(ILocaliser localiser)
        : base(new NaoBody())
    {
        _localiser = localiser;
    }

    public override void Initialise()
    {
        // Request that a RoboViz remote is created.
        // It will be disposed of automatically when the agent exits.
        var roboViz = CreateRoboVizRemote();

        // Create a 5-pixel, blue dot to indicate the agent's calculated position, hidden initially.
        // Keep a reference to this object so that we can manipulate it later.
        _locationDot = new Dot { PixelSize = 5, Color = Color.Blue, IsVisible = false };

        // Add it to the RoboViz remote using the group name 'localisation'.
        // This name will be prefixed with the side and agent number automatically.
        roboViz.Add(new ShapeSet("localisation") { _locationDot });
    }

    public override void Think(PerceptorState state)
    {
        // Provide the localiser with the latest state and see if it has a position for us.
        if (_localiser.Update(state))
        {
            // Update the dot's position.  This will automatically be reflected in the RoboViz UI.
            _locationDot.Position = _localiser.Position;

            // Make sure it's visible now that we have a position.
            _locationDot.IsVisible = true;
        }
    }
}
}}}

== Key Concepts ==

The key concepts here are:

 # Request an `IRoboVizRemote` be created using `CreateRoboVizRemote`.
 # Create a `ShapeSet` and add it to the remote.
 # Create `Shape` object(s) and add them to the `ShapeSet`.
 # Using stored references to the `Shape` object(s), manipulate their position, colour, geometry and visibility as the agent runs.

== Creating an `IRoboVizRemote` ==

To create a remote using the default options, issue the call as in the above example:

{{{
    var roboViz = CreateRoboVizRemote();
}}}

If custom options are required, use this alternative overload:

{{{
    // Specify one or more non-default options
    var options = new RoboVizOptions
                        {
                            HostName = "somehost",
                            Port = 12345,
                            UseDefaultPrefix = false
                        };
    var roboViz = CreateRoboVizRemote(options);
}}}

== Shape Sets ==

`ShapeSet` is a composite type, meaning that it may contain instances of child `ShapeSet` objects and can therefore resemble a tree structure.  A `ShapeSet` may also contain zero or more `Shape` objects.  This facility allows sub-tree filtering of `Shape` objects in the !RoboViz UI.

Each `ShapeSet` has a path that corresponds to its position in the hierarchy.  Examples are:

 * `R.A1.localisation.ball`
 * `R.A1.localisation.robot.translation`
 * `R.A1.localisation.robot.orientation`
 * `R.A1.localisation.robot.uprightvector`
 * `R.A1.planning.trajectory`

By default, an agent's team side (R or L) and uniform number (A1, A2...) are prefixed to the `ShapeSet`'s path.  This can be disabled via `RoboVizOptions.UseDefaultPrefix`.
